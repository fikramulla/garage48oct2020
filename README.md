#jupyter notebook file here - "cyberwise_detector1" - prediction classifier for cyberthreat.

#loaded with "logs.txt" file from Ali, made some mods to get "logs_clean.csv" - will post that file in private channel on slack
#work in progress - more stats testing in progress, to test for patterns, before jumping into modeling.
#hypothesis (current) - i will end up with ~5 usable features for the binary label "threat" 
#proposed algorithm - state-vector-machine (SVM) - good for binary classifications with multiple inputs, single binary output - going for quality right now, efficiency to be addressed.
